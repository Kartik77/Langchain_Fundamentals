# Langchain_Fundamentals

Langchain is an open-source framework that allows developers to build applications leveraging large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, from natural language processing to complex workflows. It integrates LLMs into pipelines using "chains," which can be sequential or parallel to automate multi-step processes. A key feature is its use of agents, which make decisions based on input to determine the appropriate actions or tools, such as interacting with APIs or databases. Additionally, sequential chains facilitate step-by-step processing, where each step’s output serves as the next step’s input, enabling structured automation and complex interactions. Overall, Langchain offers a powerful and flexible approach to incorporating LLMs into real-world applications.

This repository contains foundational code examples that can be used to understand the fundamentals of Langchain, including its concepts of agents and sequential chains. These code snippets provide a hands-on approach to exploring how to integrate large language models into various workflows, demonstrating how agents can make dynamic decisions and how sequential chains can facilitate step-by-step processing. By examining these examples, users can gain a clearer insight into building applications with Langchain and effectively leveraging its capabilities.
